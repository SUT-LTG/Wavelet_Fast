# Wavelet_Fast
This project aims to use the methods of multi-scale analysis utilizing wavelet transform on the data of different galaxies from LITTLE THINGS. Comparing and analysing the galaxy structures of the same scale in different filters is a better way to understand the physical attributes of a galaxy (e.g. star formation rate).
